# This repo is the coding challenge for Android Developer Candidates
The skeleton has been written with some simplistic Redux using Kotlin.
There are 3 missing pieces of functionality documented with "TODO"
and 1 UI bug to be fixed.

# Instructions:
    1) clone the repo
    2) Implement the missing functionality in UserRecyclerAdapter and UsersAction
       to load the users into the view and allow deleting the users
    3) commit to your Github repo
    4) send us the link to your repo so we can evaluate
    5) bonus if you write Unit Tests
